# Prize Math

Prize Math is my first iOS app developed to be published in the App Store.  The premise is a rather simple one.  I wanted to develop an app that allowed parents to reward their children for learning basic arithmetic.  The rewards or prizes are specified by the parent or user.  For example, a user could quickly take a photo of a toy he or her child wanted and assign is as a prize to be won.  

How to Play:

A user answers math questions by touching the displayed buttons and submitting answers by swiping right.  Answers can be cleared by swiping left.

After a predetermined number of questions are answered correctly the app changes to a “Bonus Mode” where the user will be presented with another round of math questions to be answered.  Bonus Mode can be complicated by including a timer and/or “Complications”.  Complications are button animation that make selected the number button more difficult.  “Gravity” and “Orbit” are shown below:

If the user is successful in answering the bonus questions he or she is award a prize:
