# Prize Math

Prize Math is my first iOS app developed to be published in the App Store.  The premise is a rather simple one.  I wanted to develop an app that allowed parents to reward their children for learning basic arithmetic.  The rewards or prizes are specified by the parent or user.  For example, a user could quickly take a photo of a toy he or her child wanted and assign is as a prize to be won.  

How to Play:

A user answers math questions by touching the displayed buttons and submitting answers by swiping right.  Answers can be cleared by swiping left.

After a predetermined number of questions are answered correctly the app changes to a “Bonus Mode” where the user will be presented with another round of math questions.  Bonus Mode can be complicated by including a timer and/or “Complications”.  "Complications" are button animations that make selecting the number buttons more difficult.  “Gravity” and “Orbit” are shown below:

If the user is successful in answering the bonus questions he or she is awarded a prize:

The uses can access previously won prices be touching the “Prizes” tab:

The user is able to change the settings of the app by clicking on the settings icon in the navigation bar.  In Settings, the user is able to choose the type of math question, Min & Max Values, additional options, and the theme of the app.

A passcode can be set to prevent other uses from changing the bonus questions and/or prizes.

Under the Set Bonus Question option, Parents can define the bonus questions by selecting the Type of question to be asked, setting a complication, choosing to make the bonus round timed or not and also defining the actual questions or allowing the app to create them randomly.
